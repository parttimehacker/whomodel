The WhoView class is used to encapsulate several MQTT publish methods and RESTful API calls to a Django web server. This class is used in my do it yourself home automation system. 
# djangoview 
The DjangoView class is used to encapsulate several RESTful API calls to a Django web server. This class is used in my *do it yourself home automation system* (**DIYHA**). Each python DIYHA application is hosted on a Raspberry Pi server. An **asset** application is used to capture CPU status and the platorm infomation, e.g., Raspbian version and Raspberry server model and version. Examples of other uses of this class:
- **clock** app identifies movement in a room via a PIR sensor and the reports to the MQTT and django servers.
- **sensor** app measures and reports on several room environment data, e.g., temperature, humidity, lux.
- **switch** app uses PIR movement and MQTT topics to turn on a AC power outlet. It also reports on the movement.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  - This is one of six classes used in my home automation system (**DIYHA**). I've used OOP and MVC concepts in my DIYHA system. 
- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
  - I wanted to isolate the django rest_framework code into a single class. The main python application only uses PUT requests to update information.
- What is the purpose of your project?
  - My home automation system contains environment sensors, motion sensors, LED clocks, light switches, emergency sirens, a django web server, interfaces to Adafruit.io and a mosquitto MQTT broker.
- Why did you undertake it?
  - This was a fun project to learn about python, Raspberry Pi, Arduino processors, hardware and more.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Django Web Server - version 3.2.8
- python - version 3.7.3
- paho.mqtt.client - version TBD
- gpiozero - version TBD

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Provides django server rest_framework interface via python **requests** GET, PUT, POST and DELETE functions
- Isolates the django process to update the web server from the rest of the application
- Code passes pylint with a score of 10.0
